# Following text was written as a Reflection assignment on Proteins edx course.
# I think it could be useful.

I am master degree student at the Department Of Matematics and Information Technology and currently I’m finishing my MSc thesis on structural biology (I’m writing binding enhancement algorithm for directed mutagenesis in monoclonal antibodies). There are subjects I know well and subjects I don’t know at all. Therefore, some material covered in this course was new to me and was worth attention.

1st Homework turned out to be most exciting and anew part. I knew about elements of protein secondary structure earlier, but the thing I did not know that alpha helices appear in two types with 3.7 or 5.1 amino acids per turn.

Everything else is rather a set of pieces making my overall understanding more complete.

I did not learn something new about antibodies, rather I got excited once again how difficult our immune system is, despite the fact that the binding mechanism is quite simple and effective. Why I think it’s effective? Misformed antibodies are quite rare, and being specific to bad antigen is more likely than to become specific to some useful protein, thus leading to autoimmune diseases. I’m also glad that in the near future I will not be covered the red spots everywhere, since I already have the chickenpox antibodies.

The more I learn, the more I get excited how complex we are. From the blood, providing built-in clotting mechanism to prevent tampering in the circulatory system, to higher nervous activity, leading to a variety of behaviors and thus forming human mind.

The most stunning thing is, that after all that art-science-love-poetry and other creations of our minds (including this course), at the cellular level we are still the same soup of proteins inside the membranes, flavored with the small amount of DNA and RNA.
