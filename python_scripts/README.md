# What it is

triangulator.py - script builds delaunay trianglulation (from numpy) and finds nearest points between 2 surfaces,
totally useless.

main_pipeline,py - decoration to select aa, and call ala_scan.py

ala_scan.py - almost unmodified alascan protocol script from pyrosetta

make_it_simple.py - temporary file to select hotspot regions correctly
